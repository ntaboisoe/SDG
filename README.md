🌐 **Deployed App**: [https://student-predictor.streamlit.app/](https://student-predictor.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many students struggle with academic performance due to lifestyle factors like poor time management, inadequate sleep, or high stress levels. Educators, parents, and even students themselves often lack data-driven tools to understand how these factors affect academic outcomes.

## 💡 My Solution

I’ve built a machine learning-powered **Student Grade Predictor** that analyzes lifestyle habits — specifically **study hours**, **sleep hours**, and **stress levels** — to forecast a student's expected grade. This empowers stakeholders with actionable insights to drive academic success.

## 🚀 The Product

This Streamlit web app allows users to:
- 🔍 Predict a student’s grade using simple sliders or a CSV upload
- 📊 Explore lifestyle-to-performance relationships visually
- 🧠 Leverage a trained Random Forest model for batch or single predictions
- 📥 Download sample templates for bulk scoring

The app is lightweight, intuitive, and ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud.

## 🎯 Target Market

- **Parents & Guardians**: To monitor and support their children’s academic health
- **Schools & Educators**: To identify at-risk students early and offer personalized interventions
- **EdTech Platforms**: As an integrated module for performance advisory tools
- **Students**: To reflect on their habits and optimize for better outcomes

## 🌍 Social Impact

By enabling early prediction and intervention, this solution:
- Reduces dropout rates
- Promotes mental wellness through lifestyle awareness
- Helps close performance gaps across socioeconomic backgrounds
- Supports data-driven parental engagement in academics
